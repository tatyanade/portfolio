Project Description.

I will create a set of finger-augmentations that fit on my (and others with similair sized fingers) hand. These will bend with my fingers and look realistic, augmenting my body and pushing the boundary of prosthetics and cyborg.

I will have the visible part of my piece imitate the appearance and texture of human skin so that it does not look noticeably out of place at first glance.

I will make it functional by having an external tendon system embedded within the silicone that is linked to the movement of the actual tendon, and its placement will cause it to bend with the wearer.





Maximum amount justfification


While with the minimum amount I would be able to construct a functioning piece, the maximum amount would allow me to buy tools and supplies that would allow me to create a convincingly flesh like appendage. The extra supplies would allow for more natural texturing and painting, and additional material would allow for more iterations.


Relevance to the grant:


This project is at the frontier because it ties into interest in cyborgs, augmenting the body. While projects in a similar vein have been explored before (Dani Clode's 3rd Thumb; Marcia Nolte's Corpus 2.0 & 2.1), they are more theoretical concepts or speculative fictions, and have not been realized or developed, or not been intended to fit in with the actual human body in the physical world. It is at the frontier by being in context with conversations that arise with technology that concern what it means to be cyborg/post-human. It brings in elements of prosthetic and sfx,  and utilizes them to extend the body past its original form and function. It is relevant in terms of how it is being made as I will be using available technologies such as 3d printing and laser cutting to iterate and create the finalized design.
